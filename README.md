# SeriesManagement
A Java Spring Application to create and read Series for overlooking which Series you want to watch or already have watched.

If you want to use your own json files, you have to configure the "PROPERTIES_PATH" in Config.java to your own .properties file.

The path to a json file should look like: seriesJSON=\path\to\json\file.json
